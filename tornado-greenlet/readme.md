# Greenlet-Tornado
# ================

# An easy way to seamlessly use Greenlet with Tornado.
# ----------------------------------------------------

# This allows you to write code as if it were synchronous, and not worry about callbacks at all.
# You also don't have to use any special patterns, such as writing everything as a generator.

# Overall this allows you to structure your program in a much more sensible, straightforward way.
# It's also immensely helpful when porting synchronous code to Tornado.
